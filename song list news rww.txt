Get ready for the grand return of Jackson twirling to music again with a big musical extravaganza with over 100 song tracks from my past life! As long as the Sex Pistols do not make me angry and cranky anymore, as long as Daddy won't be with me, as long as I'm not talking about them ever again, and as long as I don't get another rash on my butt and try to be careful, I can twirl to music again!

There's 100 songs by many of the musical artists I've loved over the past such as The Wiggles, The Cockroaches, The Residents, The Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, Billy Childish, Jamie Reid, KRK Ryden, The Beatles, Gorillaz, Oingo Boingo, Mental as Anything, They Might Be Giants, Devo, Mark Mothersbaugh, Taylor Swift, Elvis Presley, Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, The Church of the SubGenius, Batmobile, Imminent Hour, Logan Thirtyacre, Monty Python, Wyoming artists, Colorado artists, Nirvana, Ten Pole Tudor, The Punk Rock Socks, Tom Petty, The Ramones, Joan Jett, Metallica, Motorhead, Sesame Street, Barney the Dinosaur, Tomodachi Life, GoAnimate, Scorsayzee, Saul Bass, Pablo Ferro, DeviantArt, Area 7, Frank Zappa, Eminem, Slayer, SugarComa, Irving Berlin, Taco, and many more!  These songs will be on some CD's ready to listen to if I can have my CD player back or not! I'm old enough to listen to all of these no matter how old I really am, and I won't cuss just like them if they did!
