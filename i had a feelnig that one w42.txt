I had a feeling that the Church of the SubGenius was what led to my repetitive talking and thinking, as well as my stupid Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons vandalism.

I had a feeling that no one should be like or die like Clyde Bruckman although his biography and work with Buster Keaton and The Three Stooges was interesting.

I had a feeling that the Sex Pistols are definitely not a good band to listen to and could make one angry.

I had a feeling that the cartoon girls including the Ashleys, the Kanker Sisters, the tuxedo girls, and the pre-ACCV Kickline Girls made me very sexy and also affected my brain, penis, and body.

I had a feeling that Donald Trump was the one who ruined everything for me including my interest in U.S. Presidents and History and everything else in my own personal life.

I had a feeling that I am definitely too old for the Wiggles and so we do not need to be liking them anymore.

I had a feeling that nobody would like Logan Thirtyacre and that no one should be like him or talk like him at all.

I had a feeling that Michael Hemschoot would not be a friend, hero, or partner of mine.

I had a feeling that I am nothing like Terry Gilliam and that he also led to my repeated attempts to become a famous artist, animator, and/or filmmaker.

What do you think of my true opinions? Are they all true you think based on what we know? Tell me for me please!
