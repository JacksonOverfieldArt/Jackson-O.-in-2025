Congratulations! We've finally done it! Here's everything we've finally accomplished:

* Mr. Ryan is no longer in my life, talking, and memory
* I'm no longer with Miss Sami or Miss Clementine
* Paul Reubens and Jamie Reid have both died around the same time of 2023
* I am now old to do whatever I want
* I'm no longer with Daddy anymore, which means I will not talk to him, live with him, be with him, go out with him, or see him ever again due to being bothered and annoyed by everything
* I confirmed that MrBeast, Bob Clampett, The Simpsons, and Elvis Presley are not people that I like, and that even though they have bothered me all the time thanks to 7-Eleven and the Google Image Searches, I will never ever start liking any of them at all
* Mimmy and Daddy have noth retired and no longer do deliveries or house painting business anymore which means that TSP Painting Services is now officially defunct as of August 2024
* Alison, Chelsea, Candy, and Veronica were originally going to to be my official cartoon girl group after all these years, but due to them bothering me, I have decided to instead get rid of them due to inappropriate pop culture references and some obvious stealing from DeviantArt
* I am now officially with Laradon forever, originally for the food deliveries, I am not anymore thank goodness. I am only going there just for the 2-hour fun activities with friends and staff members and not anything else there anymore
* I am now officially with Dr. Klein and Dr. Lauren as long as they do not retire which they won't of course
* I told Daddy not to to be funny and cuss and do jokes anymore because it all bothers me of course and he confirmed that he doesn't do any of that any more, nor does he listen to or watch Edgar Bergen, Star Trek, or The Doors anymore either
* We have confirmed that Charlie McCarthy and Mr. Spock do not have anything to to to do with me at all, however, I have attempted to legally change my middle name from "McCarthy" to something else
* From now on I will only get money for Christmas and Birthday and not anything else
* I have finally reached 20 years old of age
* I finally got a brand new Windows 11 computer from Walmart using two 100 dollar bills all by myself
* Former President Jimmy Carter has already died at the age of 100 he had just turned, it was very sad
* Donald Trump has won the election and not Kamala Harris he has just been sworn in to office today. This probably marks the end of my complaints and and dealings about Trump
* My grandma, Betty Vesco, who is Mimmy's mom from Kansas, has just died at the age of 92 due to a hospital stroke. I'm very sorry to hear that and Mimmy was so sad about it, but not me, but it had nothing to do with me at all and I will not be attending the funeral in Casper, Wyoming at all
* Daddy is now in Montana along with his sister, but when he comes back here in Denver, Colorado, I'm still not going to be with him or live with him at all
* The Church of the SubGenius, Clyde Bruckman, the Sex Pistols, amongst others, are now officially gone for me because I am banned from every single one of them because I am not allowed to like or talk about any of those topics anymore
* My stupid Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons vandalism of Fozzie Bear and Sesame Street SubGenius and Bruckman related threats is probably over now
* I don't have to do my own artwork, movies, and animations anymore if I don't want to
* The Oobi Bunch has finally been revived and edited for 2025 after a couple years of a hiatus from 2019 to 2025. They have not been seen or edited since probably about 2019
* I am now taking medicines relating to anger issues and ADHD every single morning and night and I no longer misbehave and cuss all the time nowadays
* I am now taking showers every morning when I wake up
* I am now going out with only Mimmy, and myself walking, instead of Daddy
* We talked about all of this all the way through
* I am staying in Denver, Colorado in this same Momtmartre apartment room for the rest of my life

Thank you everybody for all of this to me!
